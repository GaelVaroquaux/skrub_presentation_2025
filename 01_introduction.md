# srkub for tables: Less wrangling, more machine learning

## Machine learning: making the best of data

- We live in a data-intensive era
- Machine learning is central to using complex data


## Real-life machine learning

**Data scientist**: Data preparation is most of the work
- It's not automated, hence manual trial and error
- Machine-learning is more fun because more general
- Data science needs interactive exploration & iteration


**Production engineer**: Data scientist's code cannot be put in production
- All code lives in notebook / UI good for interactive exploration
- No clean predictor going from the database to the prediction


## Python toolchain

- scikit-learn: 3M downloads a day
- pandas: 10M downloads a day


## Machine learning 101

- We 'fit' models on a 'train' data, with "X" and "y"
- On a 'test' dataset, the model can predict
- Prediction error should always be measured on data never seen during fit
